# Datasets for Cell Type Classification (CTC)

The 'websheet' folder corresponds to the WebSheet dataset, in which the folder 'Files' includes a random selection of 50 tables (spreadsheets), and the 'annotations.txt' provides their labeled regions of three types, i.e. IndexName, Index, and ValueName.

'saus', 'cius', 'deex' corresponds to the other three datasets as mentioned in our paper. 'saus.jl.gz', 'cius.jl.gz', 'deex.jl.gz' provides their labeled regions of cell types (i.e. MetaData, Notes, Derived, TopAttribute, LeftAttribute and Data) in a compressed jsonlines format.
