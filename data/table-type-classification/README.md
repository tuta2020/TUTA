# Datasets for Table Type Classification (TTC)

Original files of the WCC dataset can be found at [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tmy29tz9nzrcpo6/AAC356QkWE39Ho3HiYQHKcq5a?dl=0).

Here, we also provide a light version that removes many contents redundant for TUTA. 
`WCC_content.jl` contains the web table contents recorded in turns of rows. 
`WCC_annotated.jl` includes their table-type annotations: entity (E), relational (R), matrix (M), list (L), and non-data (ND).
