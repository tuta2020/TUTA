on Macromolecules (CERM) Research units : [en] Nanocomposites of polycaprolactone
(PCL) filled with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were foamed by
supercritical CO2 in order to prepare materials with reduced electromagnetic
interference (EMI). Two mixing techniques were used, i.e., melt blending
and co-precipitation. Shielding efficiency as high as 60 to 80
dB together with a low reflectivity was observed at a
very low vol% of MWNTs (0.25 vol%). The reflectivity of
the nanocomposites was advantageously decreased upon foaming. The uniformity of
the open-cell structure was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. These
foamed PCL/MWNT nanocomposites are very promising EMI shielding materials because
their performances result from absorption at low filler content and
not from reflection at relatively high filler content as was
previously the case. Abstract : [en] nanostructured

2013-07 Newsletter | Parent's Guide to Cord Blood Foundation |
Parent's Guide to Cord Blood | Brookeville MD 20833 |
USA
Cord Blood by the Numbers In spite of all its
potential, 95% of cord blood is simply thrown out. Sadly,
we had to join this statistic. With public donation off
the table this time around, and private banking beyond our
financial reach, we regretfully disposed of our twins' cord blood.
What I don't regret is the time and effort I
spent educating myself. I feel satisfied that I made a
conscious decision, acted responsibly on our children's behalf, and earned
a star on my 'mommy beret'. However, research is underway
that could tip the balance of whether and where to
donate. For one, researchers are working on ways to do
more with less cord blood so that the smallest amount
of baby cord blood could be used for transplants of
full-grown adults one day. This could encourage parents to save
their child's cord blood, because public banks throw out most
of the cord blood donations they receive. Just as crucially,
research is advancing on treating cerebral palsy, autism, diabetes, heart
disease, and many other relatively common diseases with cord blood.
Families that have their own cord blood in storage have
raw material ready for these therapies. If successful, and I
don't think this is an exaggeration, cord blood could become
a modern miracle that saves untold lives and improves the
quality of life for practically everyone. We found out that,
since we are not racially or ethnically diverse, we would
stand a good chance

strategies to expand cord blood use for transplants Frances Verter,
PhD, Parent's Guide to Cord Blood Foundation Today more than
50,000 stem cell transplants are performed annually worldwide, and that
number is growing. Only 30% of U.S. patients who need
a stem cell transplant can find a suitable donor within
their family, while the rest must turn to public registries
of bone marrow donors and donated cord blood units. Luckily,
cord blood transplants do not have to be as perfectly
matched as bone marrow transplants, so they are increasingly used
for patients with hard to match genetic types, such as
patients of mixed race

Advisory Committee Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Master of Engineering
Degree Device Selection Criteria --Based on Loss Modeling and Figure
of Merit Title etd-05272008-143141 URN ying@vt.edu Author's Email Address Ying,

ETD etd-05272008-143141
Keywords Device Selection Loss Modeling Figure of Merit Date of
Defense 2008-03-28 Availability unrestricted Abstract With the increasing speed of
the microprocessor and its rapidly increasing demand for power, determining
how to power the microprocessors for our computers becomes an
important issue. So far, industry has been struggling to operate
the VR/VRM at higher and higher switching frequencies while maintaining
acceptable power conversion efficiency. As a consequence, the power switches
used in the VR/VRM must be able to work efficiently
at a higher switching frequency and with a higher current
density. To evaluate the performance of the MOSFET for this
low-output-voltage, high-current and high-switching-frequency application, a prevalent criterion, the Figure-of-Merit
(FOM), is being widely adopted for determining the top switch
of the buck converter in the VR/VRM. By comparing the
FOMs of different devices, the device with the lowest FOM
value should have the best performance and lead to the
lowest loss for this device in the circuit. Qgd*Rdson is
a widely accepted and widely used FOM for power devices.
Due to the lack of accuracy of the power loss
model, this FOM is no longer suitable for VRM applications.
Furthermore, the question of how to use this FOM to
select the right device for different application is another important
issue.

Pages/Duration: Pacific Islands Studies Thesis (M.A.)--University of Hawaii at Manoa,
1983 Description: My motive in translating A. Cabeza Pereiro was
relatively simple. While at the University I discovered that only
a limited number of Pacific scholars read Spanish. I thus
thought it might be useful to translate something from the
Pacific Collection's extensive Spanish language holdings and thereby make it
available to a wider audience. I selected Cabeza for this
project because, after examining a number of books and articles
in Spanish, I became convinced that his history would be
of great interest to both scholars and Ponapeans. 1 hope
that time will prove my choice correct. I should call
attention to one or two peculiarities in Cabeza's history that
made its translation somewhat frustrating. First, he was either indifferent
to detail or very poorly edited by his publisher. Whatever
the reason, the original work contains a number of small
but irritating errors of fact. As the translator, I was
faced with the problem

Hi all,=0AI have recently started working on the openJMS version
0.7.6.1 re= lease and found that there has been bug
reported 1165743 for the non remova= l of the non-
subscribed topic messages.=0A=0AThe work around for this bug = can
be =0A1.) Use the expiry time.=0A2.) Add the dummy consumers
for all th= e topics which consume the messages and
hence the DB is cleaned.=0A=0AAbove= two formulas does not seem
suitable for my system as=0A=0A1.) This imposes= the contraint and
it is tricky to get the proper exrity time value.=0A2.)
= This one is out side the openJMS and will
be an overhead if the OpenJMS eng= ine is changed
for some installation.=0A=0AThis bug has been fixed in the n=
ew alpha releases and Tim pointed out that it is
difficult to backport to r= elease as some reference counting
mechanism is introduced.=0A=0AHas any one= tried some thing else at
the open JMS code level so as to avoid this.
Prob= abaly some cleanup call

Showing 4 results of 4 Flat | Threaded [Tora-develop] QList
or std::list which one do you preffer? From: <ivan@cv...> -
2012-08-15 11:43:50 I just found something which made me bit
angry. This code (in tora3 branch) did not work. Both
Params and par are instances of QList. bool toResult::setSqlAndParams(const QString
&sql, toQueryParams const& par) if (SQL == sql && par.size()
== Params.size()) { 1. toQueryParams::const_iterator i = par.begin(); toQueryParams::iterator j
= Params.begin(); 2. while (i != par.end() && j !=
Params.end()) { if (QString(*i) != QString(*j)) break; i++; j++; }
if (i == par.end() && j == Params.end()) return force;
} The code successfully compiles and no warning is reported.
1. i is of type const_iterator and is initialized from
non-const_iterator. As a result it's member points into uninitialized memory.
2. const_iterator is compared with non-const_iterator returned from end(). the
result is undefined even if it compiles smoothly. It look
like QT's iterators are not C++ compliant: https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-12941 https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-23343 I
just thought, that as we use QT framework, we should
use it for everything. But now I really want to
switch back to stl (or boost). Ivan ---------------------------------------------------------------- This message

Latest News How the Class of 2006 should have been
ranked04/26/2011 Orangebloods.com The NFL Draft is two days away and
as is usually the case, the state of Texas will
have fingerprints all over the proceedings, with a number of
first, second and third round picks (among others) coming not
only from the Lone Star State, but from the Class
of 2006. Overall, the class was much stronger across the
board than the 2007 Class, which we profiled a few
days ago, but the bust rate was still high at
the top of the board, although there were a number
of big-time stars that emerged over time. Here's a look
at how the Class of 2006 probably should have been
rated with a little history to lean on. Still hope

Posted on Jan 27, 2014 Recap: Phoenix Suns Slide Past
Philadelphia 76ers, 124-113 // ]]> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Phoenix Suns Blog
Complete Coverage > The Phoenix Suns won a messy one
in Philadelphia. The Suns offset 19 turnovers and 25 personal
fouls with a season high 12 blocks as well as
11 steals and a +6 margin on the glass. Gerald
Green was white hot for Phoenix scoring 30 points on
a mere 12 shots. Goran Dragi? was a searing second
banana with 24 points of his own to go with
7 assists and 3 steals. The Suns never trailed en
route to matching their season high in scoring with a
124-113 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers started this
one looking out of sync, with a timeout after the
Suns' first score that resulted in... a turnover and Gerald
Green to Miles Plumlee alley-oop. The Suns for their part
looked sharp on offense hitting their first six shots... all
assisted! Not too shabby for the worst assisting team in
the league. And even when they missed, they scored, getting
points on all of their first ten possessions to race
out to a 21-9 lead with over 6 minutes left
in the first quarter. The streak ended with two Plumlee
missed free throws but the Suns were still able to
get an offensive rebound thanks to P.J. Tucker's hustle. Channing
Frye missed a three-point attempt, but that hardly cooled the
Suns down. After extending the lead to 36-22, the Suns
got a little sloppy allowing

Italian biplane fighter aces � Piero Vodret
Claims: Vodret ended the war with 1 biplane victory. Tenente
Piero Vodret remained as CO of the 391a Squadriglia until
the Armistice. During the war, he was decorated with the
Croce di Guerra al valor militare. In 1943, he still
served in the 50o Stormo. This was the last successful
combat of the Squadriglia, which was withdrawn to Italy on
15 January 1943 to be re-equipped with Fiat G.50bis Between
14.10 and 15.05 on 27 October 1942 a formation of
five CR.42s from the Squadriglia (equipped with three aircraft of
their own and two borrowed from 389a and 390a Squadriglie)
attacked armoured vehicles in the Tell el Tisa area. In
this area the 9th Australian Division with support from 51st
British Division and 1st British Armoured Division was attacked by
the 164th German division at the Kidney Ridge. The 15th
Panzer Division and the Littorio Division supported the German division.
The Squadriglia became heavily engaged by enemy fighters and in
the ensuing combat one P-40 was claimed by Tenente Vodret
who also claimed a second as a damaged. His aircraft
was then hit in the oil cooler and he was
forced to make an emergency landing at El Ostegia. Tenente
Jadanza claimed a P-40 and a second as a damaged
while Sottotenente Marini claimed a damaged. Tenente Piero Vodret became
CO of the 391a Squadriglia of 159o Gruppo, 50o
Biplane victories: 1 destroyed, 1 damaged. TOTAL: 1 destroyed, 1
damaged. Sources: Ali d'Africa - Michele Palermo and Ludovico Slongo,
